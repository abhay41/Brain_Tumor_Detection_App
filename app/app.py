# # Flask Web Application for Tumor Classification/Analysis

# """
# This is a Flask-based web application designed for medical image analysis, 
# specifically focused on tumor classification/detection.

# Application Components and Configuration:
# - Uses Flask as the web framework
# - Implements user authentication with Flask-Login
# - Utilizes SQLAlchemy for database management
# - Supports file uploads for medical imaging

# Key Configuration Details:
# 1. Database Configuration:
#    - Uses SQLite database (tumor_app.db)
#    - Stores user information and potentially analysis results

# 2. File Upload Configuration:
#    - Upload directory set to 'static/uploads'
#    - Allows storing user-uploaded medical images

# 3. Security Configurations:
#    - Sets a secret key for session management
#    - Configures login management 
#    - Disables ASCII-only JSON responses for potential international character support

# Main Application Setup:
# - Initializes Flask application
# - Configures database connection
# - Sets up login management
# - Loads user authentication mechanism
# - Configures application routes
# - Creates database tables on first run
# - Runs the application in debug mode

# User Authentication Flow:
# - Uses Flask-Login for managing user sessions
# - Provides a login view for authentication
# - Implements a user loader function to retrieve user information

# Startup Behavior:

#   1. Creates all database tables if they don't exist
#   2. Starts the web server in debug mode
